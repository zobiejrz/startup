# Notes

I just finished the github assignment. I learned how to make my new github account, how to make my first repository, and how to handle my first merge conflict. [I also considered adding a link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md "It was strongly considered").
